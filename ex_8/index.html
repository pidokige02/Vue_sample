<!--  what was learned
      Components are blocks of code, grouped together within a custom element
      Components make applications more manageable by breaking up the whole into reusuable parts that have their own structure and behavior
      Data on a component must be a function
      Props are used to pass data from parent to child
      We can specify requirements for the props a component is receiving
      Props are fed into a component through a custom attribute
      Props can be dynamically bound to the parent’s data
      Vue dev tools provide helpful insight about your components

  <!--  We’ve given our product component a prop, or a custom attribute, called premium. 
        We are binding that custom attribute : to the premium that lives in our instance’s data.
